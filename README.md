1.Title: Agri – IoT: A Semantic Framework for Internet of Things-enabled Smart Farming Application.
Author: Andreas Kamilaris, FengGaoy, Francesc X.Prenafeta-Boldu , Muhammad IntizarAliy 2016 European Union.
These paper proposes Agri-IoT, a semantic framework for IoT based smart farming applica- tions, which supports reasoning over various heterogeneous sensor data streams in real-time.
These system implements Agri-IoT ecosystem Architecture where it focuses in two scenarios are fertility management of dairy cows and soil fertility for crop cultivation.
 Methods used in proposed systems are:
1 .Agriculture ontology.
2. Semantic sensor network.
3. Complex Event Service Ontology.
Advantages of proposed system over existing systems are:
1.Agri-IoT can integrate multiple cross-domain data streams, providing a complete semantic processing pipeline, offering a common framework for smart farming applications.
2.Agri-IoT supports large-scale data analytics and event detection, ensuring seamless inter- operability among sensors, services, processes, operations, farmers and other relevant actors, including online information sources and linked open datasets and streams available on the web.
 Research Gap:
The system addresses limitations like include dynamicity, autonomy and full adaptability to heterogeneity.

3. Title: Crop Selection Method to Maximize Crop Yield Rate using Machine Learning Technique
Author: Rakesh Kumar, M.P. Singh, Prabhat Kumar and J.P. Singh. India May 2015.
This paper proposed a method named Crop Selection Method (CSM) to solve crop selection problem, and maximize net yield rate of crop over season and subsequently achieves maximum economic growth of the country. According to CSM the crops are classified as:
a)Seasonal crops— crops can be planted during a season. eg. wheat, cotton.
b)Whole year crops— crops can be planted during entire year. eg. vegetable, paddy, Toor. These research paper tells about various machine learning techniques and algorithms. Algorithms and method used in proposed system are:
1 .CSM Algorithm: CSM algorithm works on prediction of crop yield rate based on favorable condition in advance and gives a sequence of crops with highest net yield rate.
Advantage of proposed system is:
To improve net yield rate of crops to be planted over season.
The proposed method resolves selection of crops based on prediction yield rate influenced by parameters (e.g. weather, soil type, water density, crop type).
Research Gap:
Limitations of proposed system is that the performance and accuracy of CSM method depends on predicted value of influenced parameters, so there is a need to adopt a prediction method with more accuracy and high performance.
Use in our system:
Hence after analyzing these paper we are using the crop sowing table for classification of crops according to sowing period and harvesting period depends on monsoon.

8.Title: Classification rules for Indian Rice diseases
Author: A.Nithya, Dr. V. Sundaram India 2011.
This paper intended to discover classification rules for the Indian rice diseases using the c4.5 decision trees algorithm. Expert systems have been used in agriculture since the early 1980s. Several systems have been developed in different countries including the USA, Europe, and Egypt for plant disorder diagnosis, management and other production aspects. This paper ex- plores what Classification rule can do in the agricultural domain.
Algorithms used in these paper are
C4.5 Decision tree:
C4.5 performs top down induction of Decision trees from a set of examples which have each been given a classification. Typically, a training set will be specified by the user. The root of the tree specifies an attribute to be selected and tested first, and the subordinate nodes dictate tests on further attributes. The leaves are marked to show the classification of the object they represent.
The ID3 Algorithm:
The ID3 algorithm is a decision tree building algorithm which determines classification of ob- jects by testing values of their properties. It builds tree in top down fashion, starting from set of objects and specification of properties.
Advantages of these research is to analyze the symptoms for identifying which type of disease and pest will affect the crop.
Limitations:
The research only considers the rice for predicting disease and symptoms. Use in our system: We are using these results and advantages for our system implementation if the crop to be cultivated is rice.
