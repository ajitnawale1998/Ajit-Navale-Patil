Requirement Specification:-
Requirement specification describes the function and performance of the computer based system
and constraints which govern its development. It can be a written document, a set of graphical models,
a collection of scenarios, or any combination of above.

1 Requirement Specification
Requirement specification describes the function and performance of the computer based system
and constraints which govern its development. It can be a written document, a set of graphical models,
a collection of scenarios, or any combination of above.
These are of 3 types:

1.1 Normal Requirements
These are the requirement which are clearly state by the customer so all these requirements will be
present in the project for customer satisfaction.
• N1 : Collect the information of farmer.
• N2: Every user should easily access the web portal.
• N3: Correct input data should be entered by farmer.
• N4: Correct prediction to the farmers regarding crop is given properly.
• N5: Every farmer should get the crop cultivation process in audio and video formats.
• N6: Every farmer gets the information about the disease and fertilizers for curing them based
on the symptoms provided by the farmer.
• N7: Every farmer gets proper location about fertilizers and pesticide shops and dealers.

1.2 Expected Requirements
These requirements are implicit type of requirements, these requirements are not clearly stated by
customer but implicitly comes during system design.
• E1: Registration form should be designed.
• E2: Valid input are to be taken.
• E3: The input data is stored in the data set.
• E4: Prediction of crop is done with the ML algorithm.
• E5: Cultivation process link are provided in different formats.
• E6: Location of the pest dealers are provided using Machine Learning algorithm.

1.3 Exited Requirements
These requirements are neither stated by the customer nor expected. But to achieve total customer
satisfaction the developer may include certain requirements which enhance the functionalities of the
product.


2 Validation of Requirement
A validation criterion is probably the most important point, the most often neglected section of
software requirement specification. How do we recognize a successful implementation? What classes
of tests must be conducted to validate the functions, performance and constraints? We neglect this
section because completing its demands through understanding of software requirement, something
that we often do not at this stage. Yet, the specification of validation criteria acts as an implicit review
of all requirements. It is essential that time and attention to be given to this section.
2.1 Normal Requirement
• VNR1: The system collects the information of the farmer using registration form.
• VNR2: After Registration user can log in into portal.
• VNR3: The input data should be successfully accepted.
• VNR4: The system will execute the classification algorithm and then shows the correct predic-
tion about the crop to the farmer.
• VNR5: The system will provide the links and transcriptions about the video and audio.
• VNR6: The system provides the list of symptoms using checkbox and farmer will select the
appropriate checkbox foe the symptoms information and appropriate fertilizers will be recom-
mended by the system associated with symptoms.
• VNR7: The system gives proper location of the fertilizers and pesticides shops and dealers
using the farmers location.

2.2 Expected Requirement
• VER1 : The proper Registration form is designed using HTML and CSS. using this form the
customer will be able to login.
• VER2 :After giving unique username and password which will match with the username and
password provided at the time of registration. After this the user can be abl to login successfully.
• VER3 : The available dataset is provided by Kaggle.com so we can extract the required field
from this dataset such as Weather conditions , Soil type and PH levels and Crops based on areas.
• VER4 : The classification algorithm- Random Forest Algorithm (RFA) will be used to classify
the soil type into different levels(Low ,Medium,High) according to the range of the soil the
crops will be recommended to the farmer.
• VER5 : Cultivation process link are provided in audio and video formats. The customer will be
redirected to the standard links of related cultivation process format.
• VER6 : Machine Learning algorithm-K-nearest neighbour algorithm is used to provide the
nearest location of the pest dealer to the farmer.

2.3 Excited Requirement
These requirements are neither stated by the customer nor expected. But to achieve total customer
satisfaction the developer may include certain requirements which enhance the functionalities of the
product.


3 System Requirements:-

3.1 Hardware Requirements
1. System : Pentium IV 2.4 GHz.
2. Hard Disk : 120 GB.
3. Ram : 512 Mb.

3.2 Software Requirements
1. Operating system : Windows 7/8/10.
2. Coding Language : JAVA
3. IDE : Eclipse
4. Database : MYSQL
2.4 Functional Requirements
 
 
 
4.1 Functional requirements are those requirements which deals with what the system should do or pro-
vide the users.

• The application is user friendly.
• It provides an easy interface to user.
• The accessibility or response time of the application should be fast.
• Performance of the system is appropriate.
• The system provides the nearby shops location.


4.2 Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements are those requirement which elaborates the performance characteristics
of the system and define the constraints on how the system do so.

 Performance Requirement
• System can produce results faster on 4GB of RAM.
• It may take more time for peak loads at main node.
• The system will be available 24 by 7 hr. Once there is a fatal error, the system will provide under-
standable feed back to the user.

Safety Requirements
• Only administrators have access to the database of each individual user.
• All data will be backed-up every day automatically and also the system administrator can back-up
the data as a function for him.
• This makes it easier to install and updates new functionality if required.
• For the safety purpose backup of the database must be required.
2.5.3 Security Requirements
• Our System is being developed in Java. Java is an object oriented programming language and shall
be easy to maintain. The system is designed in modules where errors can be detected and fixed easily.
• For the security purposes and to avoid illegal use of the system, while using

2.5.4 Availability
• The system shall be available during 24 hours of a day.

2.5.5 Usability
• The system is designed keeping in mind the usability issues considering the end-users who are
developers/programmers. It provides detailed help which would lead to better and faster learning.
Navigation of system is easy.

2.5.6 Consistency
• Uniformity in layout, screens, Menus, colours scheme, format.

2.5.7 Performance
• The performance of the system should be fast and as per user requirement. From this system we will
get expected outcome in less time and less space since efficiency is higher. Speed is totally depending
on the response of the database and connection type.

2.5.8 Reliability
• Protection of data from malicious attack or unauthorized access.

2.5.9 Security
• The system provides security to the randomly generated private key by performing encryption to
it for encrypting patient data and thus protects from other nodes in the network. The network is free
from malicious node and misbehaving node attacks.
